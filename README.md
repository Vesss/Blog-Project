# The Daily Writer

The Daily Writer is my third milestone project as part of my Full Stack Web Development course at Code Institute.

The project is a blog / news site where anyone can post an article.

The site has been built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 4 and a free Bootstrap theme from startbootstrap.com, called 'Clean Blog.'

Flask has been used for the back-end technology, and Flask's use of Jinja templating was implemented in the HTML to save the need to write additional code and to copy-paste the base / index of the blog.

Due to the fact that Flask is a Python micro web framework, Python programming logic has been implemented.

## Features

* Any visitor can see the entire content.
* Any visitor can submit an article, no registration required.
    * Upon submitting an article, the user (visitor) must mandatorily submit a title, category, image, content (actual article), and submit their name (or the name of the author, if they have copied someone else's content) in the 'Author' section.
