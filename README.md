# The Daily Writer

The Daily Writer is my third milestone project as part of my Full Stack Web Development course at Code Institute.

The project is a blog / news site where anyone can post an article.

The site has been built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 4 and a free Bootstrap theme from startbootstrap.com, called 'Clean Blog.'

Flask has been used for the back-end technology, and Flask's use of Jinja templating was implemented in the HTML to save the need to write additional code and to copy-paste the base / index of the blog.
